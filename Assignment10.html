	<p style="text-decoration: underline;"> Questions </p>
	<p> For this assignment, I have selected a coronavirus data tracker API for USA.
			It contains the total reported cases, the total reported deaths, as well as
			the total reported cases in each state. </p>
	<p> Source: <a href="https://apify.com/covid-19">https://apify.com/covid-19</a>,
			who gathers their data from <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-in-us.html">
			https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-in-us.html</a>. <br> API Data: 
			<a href="https://api.apify.com/v2/key-value-stores/moxA3Q0aZh5LosewB/records/LATEST?disableRedirect=true">
			https://api.apify.com/v2/key-value-stores/moxA3Q0aZh5LosewB/records/LATEST?disableRedirect=true </a> </p>
	<p> Some of the options that this API had was the total number of cases, total number of deaths,
			and each state's name, its total number of cases, and the range of cases. I used all the data
			provided in the API except for the range of the number of cases in each state. I feel like 
			what's important for users to know is the total number of cases and deaths. However, 
			the range may be something that medical websites want to use.
	</p>
	<p> With the pandemic still affecting our everyday lives, it's important for people
			to be aware of the current situation with the coronavirus. With this data, 
			people can easily find data about the total cases in USA, and also in the
			specific state that they live in. This API can definitely be used in medical
			or hospital websites since their top priority is to help those who are affected
			by the coronavirus. This API can also be used in news articles that talk about
			coronavirus updates. The news is another platform that can spread information about the
			pandemic to the general public. </p>
