          Here at polychrome, our team will provide the best advice for you to kickstart
          your public profile as an artist. We consistently monitor the activities in the art market
          in order to offer you the most profitable price to set for your art. We also keep close
          contacts with many large galleries and exhibition centers so that we can help our artists
          choose the best site to display their work. 
          <p>
          The most important goal for us at polychrome is to help artists execute their artist vision.
          Once you get in touch with us, we will do our best in getting to know
          you as an artist and what drives your artmaking. We will also ask about your goals
          and what you hope to achieve in your artist career. It is okay if you aren't sure what 
          you are aiming for yet. We are here to help and understand you better so that we can
          assist you in forming your goals.
